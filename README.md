## Square Overview and Company Origin

Square was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey.  In the company's infancy, Square started as an idea to enable small businesses to process sales through a mobile payments platform.  Jack Dorsey initially envisioned the idea for Square with Jim McKelvey, his former boss who was a high-end faucet & fittings glass blower looking for ways to expand his business's sales by offering additional payment methods beyond traditional cash payments.  The idea for Square eventually evolved into the company's first product, the Square Reader.  This square-shaped device enabled business owners to accept credit card payments by downloading the Square application and connecting the reader to their mobile device.

According to crunchbase.com, Square has raised a total of $601.2M over 11 rounds of venture capital and equity funding to date. The company had several rounds of Series B through E funding in 2010 through 2014 prior to its IPO in November 2015, in which the company raised approximately $243M at an implied market value of approximately $2.9B.

Since it's IPO, Square has evolved its product & service offerings well beyond it's initial Square Reader.  Square now offers an extensive suite of additional digital payment, commerce, and banking solutions for companies of all sizes within varying industries.  In addition, Square has created new products to not only support merchants, but also support the customers of merchants.

Put simply, the company has a clear goal of creating tools to empower and enrich all people.  An excerpt from the company's website states the following:

> No one should be left out of the economy because the cost is too great or the technology too complex.
> So we’re building easy tools to empower and enrich people. Tools that shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it—because we believe in fair and square.

Outside of retail and food/beverage, Square focuses its product marketing efforts on its website towards professional services (e.g., accountants & other financial advisory services, health & fitness businesses, beauty services, and home & repair businesses) as well as large business.  For large businesses, Square focuses its marketing on delivering an ecosystem of connected tools enhance the customer experience, simplify business administration & management, and track customer relationships.

In an interview with B2B News Network in 2017, Jack Dorsey clearly identified Square's competitive advantage to other competitors:

>“There have always been some differentiators, but the most important has been our cohesiveness,” he said. “We’re not just payments or POS but a suite of tools to help our sellers. The first critical thing was to enable sellers to make the sale. Then it was organizing the information to make more sales.

>“Being able to see your business helps you make decisions, about inventory and how to market,” he said, adding that creating an experience where “the hardware and software goes away” with speed and self-service is important so that businesses can focus on things that are really important to them. “The elegance of our solution is unique to us. It all works together and you don’t have to think too much about it.”

In a recent interview with WSJ, Square's CFO, Amrita Ahuja, noted one of Square's key differentiators:

>"We have the ability to sit on both sides of the counter, and figure out the ways that we can add unique value to both the merchant and the consumer in the exchange."

In terms of technology, Square utilizes a handful of programming languages and database technologies in the development of its software applications.  According to Square's company profile on Stackshare.io, the company uses software development technologies such as (but not limited to):

- **Programming Languages**: Ruby, Javascript, Objective-C
- **Database Technology**: MySQL, Redis, Vertica
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS EC2, Snowflake
- **Application Development**: Firebase

Beyond its software applications, Square also leverages newer technology to enable its POS devices and readers to accept customer payments.  One specific technology is called NFC or "Near Field Communication".  This technology enables smartphones & reader devices to communicate and execute secure, contactless payment through Apple Pay or Google Payment.

Last but not least, Square manufactures its own POS devices (i.e., restaurant card readers, in-store tablets, and other larger POS systems).

>"We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy."

>"We’re here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone."

Some of the key metrics that Square uses to measure its success are outlined below:

1. **Cash App Ecosystem**

    - **New Customer Acquisitions**: Represents growth in monthly transacting active customers on the Cash App.

        - Per Square's latest shareholder letter, the Cash App reached more than 36 million monthly transacting active customer in 2020, representing greater than 50% YOY growth.

    - **Customer Acquisition Costs**: Represents the cost to acquire each new Cash App customer.

        - Network effects of peer-to-peer transactions on the Cash App have allowed Square to maintain low customer acquisition costs of approximately $5 per new transacting active customer.

    - **Gross Profit per Customer**: Represents gross profit margin per new transacting active customer on the Cash App.

        - In December 2020, GP per new transacting active customer reached $41, up approximately 70% YOY.

    - **Bitcoin Adoption**: Represents the total number of customers that have purchased or sold Bitcoin through the Cash App.

        - In 2020, more than three million customers purchased or sold bitcoin on Cash App, and, in January 2021, more than one million customers purchased bitcoin for the first time.

2. **Seller Ecosystem**

    - **Seller GPV (Gross Payment Volume)**: Represents the total gross payment value from Square's seller ecosystem.  Seller GPV is is composed of the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds.

        - Square saw massive growth in omnichannel sellers in 2020.  An omnichannel seller is defined as a seller who has both in-person payments and online channel payments. In Q4 of 2020, GPV from omnichannel and online sellers represented more than half of Square total Seller GPV.

## Recent Acquisitions and Potential Future Products

In recent news, Square has announced two major acquisitions:

1. **Afterpay**: Announced in August 2021, Square agreed to purchase Australian-based "buy now, pay later" firm Afterpay Ltd. for $29B

    - **Future Implications for Square**: Square plans to integrate Afterpay into both its Seller POS and Cash App Ecosystems.  "Buy now, pay later" is an attractive category for Square as consumer preferences are shifting away from traditional credit cards.  Additionally, sellers view "buy now, pay later" as an opportunity to increase conversions, increase average order volumes, and acquire new customers.

    - **Technologies**:  While its yet to be seen how exactly Square will integrate Afterpay into its offerings, it's likely that this additional service will be integrated within its POS systems as well as CRM tools for sellers.  This will require enhancements to Square's software-based products and services through various programming language and database technology upgrades.

2. **Tidal**: Announced in March 2021, Square agreed to purchase Jay-Z's Tidal music stream service for $297M

    - **Future Implications for Square**: Square has yet to launch any new products as a result of its acquisition of Tidal, however many see this acquisition as an opportunity to integrate a platform for artists into Square's seller ecosystem.  This could include an e-commerce platform for artists along with improved payments and financing for live shows.  

    - **Technologies**: Similar to the acquisition of Afterpay, its likely that this acquisition will result in additional software-based products & services offered by Square.  In addition, there could be additional hardware product offerings for artist sellers.

Outside of its recent acquisitions, Square has also recently announced that it will create a new Bitcoin focused business as well as Bitcoin hardware wallet.
