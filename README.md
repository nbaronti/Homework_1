## Square Overview & Company Origin

Square was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey.  In the company's infancy, Square started as an idea to enable small businesses to process sales through a mobile payments platform.  Jack Doresey initially envisioned the idea for Square with Jim McKelvey, his former boss who was a high-end faucet & fittings glass blower looking for ways to expand his business's sales by offering additional payment methods beyond traditional cash payments.  The idea for Square eventually evolved into the company's first product, the Square Reader.  This square-shaped device enabled business owners to accept credit card payments by downloading the Square application and connecting the reader to their mobile device.

According to crunchbase.com, Square has raised a total of $601.2M over 11 rounds of venture capital and equity funding to date. The company had several rounds of Series B through E funding in 2010 through 2014 prior to its IPO in November 2015, in which the company raised approximately $243M at an implied market value of approximately $2.9B.

Since it's IPO, Square has evolved its product & service offerings well beyond it's initial Square Reader.  Square now offers an extenstive suite of additional digital payment, commerce, and banking solutions for companies of all sizes within varying industries.  In addition, Square has created new products to not only support merchants, but also support the customers of merchants.

Put simply, the company has a clear goal of creating tools to empower and enrich all people.  An excerpt from the company's website states the following:

> No one should be left out of the economy because the cost is too great or the technology too complex.
> So we’re building easy tools to empower and enrich people. Tools that shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it—because we believe in fair and square.

In an interview with B2B News Network in 2017, Jack Dorsey clearly identified Square's competitive advantage to other competitors:

>“There have always been some differentiators, but the most important has been our cohesiveness,” he said. “We’re not just payments or POS but a suite of tools to help our sellers. The first critical thing was to enable sellers to make the sale. Then it was organizing the information to make more sales.
>“Being able to see your business helps you make decisions, about inventory and how to market,” he said, adding that creating an experience where “the hardware and software goes away” with speed and self-service is important so that businesses can focus on things that are really important to them. “The elegance of our solution is unique to us. It all works together and you don’t have to think too much about it.”
